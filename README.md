# BINF5507-Assignment-2

This reposistory includes two folders, "Scripts" and "Data".

In "Data" you will find one csv file, "heart_disease_uci.csv". In "Scripts" you will find two python scripts, "Regression Models.py" and "Classification Models.py". "Regression Models.py" is a script desgined to train and evaluate linear regression models to predict cholesterol levels from the provided dataset. "Classification Models.py" is a script designed to train and evaluate logistic regression and k-NN classifiers to predict heart disease presence as a binary classification task.

The code provided does download the dataset directly from the website using OpenML. The dataset was still provided in case it must be downloaded and loaded in your directory.

Initially, this project was supposed to have the Python scripts as a jupyter notebook, however due to technical issues, PyCharm was used to run all code and they are saved as .py files.

AI DISCLAIMER: AI was utilized for debugging code to ensure all scripts run accordingly.
